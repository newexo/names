When you enter, you are greeted by the reek of scummy pond water. You enter Toad Hollow through a drainage pipe that you have to crawl through. Once inside Toad Hollow, you can stand up, but you still don't feel comfortable with your surroundings. As far as the eye can see there is muddy water in a circular basin with lily pads floating in it. On the pads, giant toads jump back and forth making gurgling, croaking sounds. As you wade deeper into Toad Hollow, the water comes up to your waist and you see the flash of a fin. There is legend that a creature lives in the center of Toad Hollow that is half human, half monster. Not even the strongest knight has been brave enough to examine it. The fin disappears back underwater but there is a red glint suggesting eyes are watching you. When you reach the other side of the basin, you crawl into another drainage pipe and feel relieved that you're out of this place.\nThere's a drainage pipe and a pad here.\nThe giant toads is here.\n\nYou are carrying nothing.", "goal": "get drainage pipe", "graph": "{\n    \"agents\": [\n        \"creature\",\n        \"giant toads\"\n    ],\n    \"nodes\": {\n        \"creature\": {\n            \"agent\": true,\n            \"aggression\": 0,\n            \"char_type\": \"person\",\n            \"classes\": [\n                \"agent\"\n            ],\n            \"contain_size\": 20,\n            \"contained_nodes\": {},\n            \"container_node\": {\n                \"target_id\": \"toad hollow_0\"\n            },\n            \"damage\": 1,\n            \"db_id\": 4603,\n            \"defense\": 0,\n            \"desc\": \"I'm a creature of the forest.
