There are dozens of painted maps on the walls and ceiling. There's a bookshelf over to the left side of the shop that holds nothing but rolled up scrolls, and some have fallen to the floor. Armor sets adorn the manikins to the back of the room. There's a vibrant royal blue knight set of armor that causes the back area to light up in a cool glow of blue.
