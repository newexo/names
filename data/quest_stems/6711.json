You enter Toad Hollow through a drainage pipe that you have to crawl through. Once inside Toad Hollow, you can stand up, but you still don't feel comfortable with your surroundings. As far as the eye can see there is muddy water in a circular basin with lily pads floating in it. On the pads, giant toads jump back and forth making gurgling, croaking sounds. As you wade deeper into Toad Hollow, the water comes up to your waist and you see the flash of a fin. There is legend that a creature lives in the center of Toad Hollow that is half human, half monster. Not even the strongest knight has been brave enough to examine it. The fin disappears back underwater but there is a red glint suggesting eyes are watching you. When you reach the other side of the basin, you crawl into another drainage pipe and feel relieved that you're out of this place.\nThere's some pads, a drainage pipe, some relic armor, and an old sword here.\nA giant turtle is here.\n\nYou are carrying nothing, and wielding a large ladle and a large club.", "goal": "get pads", "graph": "{\n    \"agents\": [\n        \"giant turtle_6\",\n        \"large mosquito_8\"\n    ],\n    \"nodes\": {\n        \"drainage pipe_4\": {\n            \"agent\": false,\n            \"classes\": [\n                \"container\",\n                \"not_gettable\",\n                \"object\"\n            ],\n            \"contain_size\": 2,\n            \"contained_nodes\": {\n                \"pitch pipe_5\": {\n                    \"target_id\": \"pitch pipe_5\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"container\": true,\n            \"container_node\": {\n                \"target_id\": \"toad hollow_0\"\n            },\n            \"db_id\": 10705,\n            \"dead\": false,\n            \"desc\": \"A drainage pipe which may or may not be filled with unsanitary contents.\",\n            \"drink\": false,\n            \"equipped\": null,\n            \"food\": false,\n            \"food_energy\": 0,\n            \"gettable\": true,\n            \"locked_edge\": null,\n            \"name\": \"drainage pipe\",\n            \"name_prefix\": \"a\",\n            \"names\": [\n                \"drainage pipe\"\n            ],\n            \"node_id\": \"drainage pipe_4\",\n            \"object\": true,\n            \"room\": false,\n            \"size\": 1,\n            \"stats\": {\n                \"damage\": 0,\n                \"defense\": 0\n            },\n            \"surface_type\": \"on\",\n            \"value\": 1,\n            \"wearable\": false,\n            \"wieldable\": false\n        },\n        \"giant pearl_7\": {\n            \"agent\": false,\n            \"classes\": [\n                \"object\"\n            ],\n            \"contain_size\": 0,\n            \"contained_nodes\": {},\n            \"container\": false,\n            \"container_node\": {\n                \"target_id\": \"giant turtle_6\"\n            },\n            \"db_id\": 11319,\n            \"dead\": false,\n            \"desc\": \"There is a pearl that is very large.\",\n            \"drink\": false,\n            \"equipped\": null,\n            \"food\": false,\n            \"food_energy\": 0,\n            \"gettable\": true,\n            \"locked_edge\": null,\n            \"name\": \"giant pearl\",\n            \"name_prefix\": \"a\",\n            \"names\": [\n                \"giant pearl\"\n            ],\n            \"node_id\": \"giant pearl_7\",\n            \"object\": true,\n            \"room\": false,\n            \"size\": 1,\n            \"stats\": {\n                \"damage\": 0,\n                \"defense\": 0\n            },\n            \"surface_type\": \"on\",\n            \"value\": 1,\n            \"wearable\": false,\n            \"wieldable\": false\n        },\n        \"giant turtle_6\": {\n            \"agent\": true,\n            \"aggression\": 0,\n            \"char_type\": \"person\",\n            \"classes\": [\n                \"agent\"\n            ],\n            \"contain_size\": 19,\n            \"contained_nodes\": {\n                \"giant pearl_7\": {\n                    \"target_id\": \"giant pearl_7\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"container_node\": {\n                \"target_id\": \"toad hollow_0\"\n            },\n            \"damage\": 1,\n            \"db_id\": 4983,\n            \"defense\": 0,\n            \"desc\": \"This has got to be the biggest sea turtle you've ever seen.

When you enter, you are greeted by the reek of scummy pond water. You enter Toad Hollow through a drainage pipe that you have to crawl through. Once inside Toad Hollow, you can stand up, but you still don't feel comfortable with your surroundings. As far as the eye can see there is muddy water in a circular basin with lily pads floating in it. On the pads, giant toads jump back and forth making gurgling, croaking sounds. As you wade deeper into Toad Hollow, the water comes up to your waist and you see the flash of a fin. There is legend that a creature lives in the center of Toad Hollow that is half human, half monster. Not even the strongest knight has been brave enough to examine it. The fin disappears back underwater but there is a red glint suggesting eyes are watching you. When you reach the other side of the basin, you crawl into another drainage pipe and feel relieved that you're out of this place.\",\n            \"extra_desc\": \"Toad Hollow is a legend among knights young and old.

Toad Hollow remains shrouded in mystery to this day and many question if it's even real.
