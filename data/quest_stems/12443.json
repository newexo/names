Though they seem thin and almost weblike, no trace of a draft comes from them.  A bed made of cloth that is both soft and warm hangs in the corner of the tent.  It seems to perfectly fit there, as though it was grown from the tent walls instead of skillfully placed.  The floor is carpeted with impossibly vibrant rugs, the likes of which no mortal eye has seen, and the walls of the tent rise up so high that the ceiling cannot be seen.  A brazier glows softly, and above it hangs a golden teapot.  Vapors rising from its spout waft into the space, smelling of cinnamon and spices. There is a soft glowing stone by one side of the tent wall that looks like a flagstone crafted from an impossibly large pearl. The tent is warm and inviting, and a little unnervingly beautiful.  Truly, this is a place worthy of the Royal Family of the Alabaster Elves.\nThere's a rug, a blanket, a brazier, a throne, a stone, a teapot, a bed, a tent, and a floor here.\nThe visitor is

Though they seem thin and almost weblike, no trace of a draft comes from them.  A bed made of cloth that is both soft and warm hangs in the corner of the tent.  It seems to perfectly fit there, as though it was grown from the tent walls instead of skillfully placed.  The floor is carpeted with impossibly vibrant rugs, the likes of which no mortal eye has seen, and the walls of the tent rise up so high that the ceiling cannot be seen.  A brazier glows softly, and above it hangs a golden teapot.  Vapors rising from its spout waft into the space, smelling of cinnamon and spices. There is a soft glowing stone by one side of the tent wall that looks like a flagstone crafted from an impossibly large pearl. The tent is warm and inviting, and a little unnervingly beautiful.
